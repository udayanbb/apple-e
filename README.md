# APPLE-E: A compliant apple picking robot

MIT 6.4212 Final Project

An exploration of manipulating through deformable clutter, in the setting of apple picking.

Implemented in [Drake](https://drake.mit.edu), large chunks duplicated from [drake](https://github.com/RobotLocomotion/drake) and [manipulation](https://github.com/RussTedrake/manipulation) repositories.

## Getting started

Run ```TreeViewer.ipynb```, up until the block titled 'Follow a trajectory with nudges', which demonstrates the complete functionality of the project. 

Some helpers are in `utils.py`.
